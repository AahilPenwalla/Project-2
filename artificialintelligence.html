    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

    <div>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and understanding natural language. AI technologies, such as machine learning, robotics, and neural networks, are transforming industries by enabling automation, improving decision-making, and enhancing user experiences. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants and medical diagnostics, AI continues to revolutionize the way we interact with technology, making processes more efficient and intelligent.</p>
